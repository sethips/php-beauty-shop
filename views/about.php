            <p>
                Believing nature holds the secret to human health, two American brothers, Sidney and Albert Musher began studying the benefits of oat in 1945. Oat was an ingredient used in skincare since ancient times for its ability to soothe and nourish the skin.  The brothers discovered the powers of finely-milled colloidal oatmeal to heal dry, compromised skin. The famous Mayo Clinic dermatologists recognized their pioneering work and the brand was born.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, we’ve published 70 years of clinical evidence supporting the benefits of not just oat, but other natural ingredients.

                How do we balance the two?
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we carefully cultivate our natural ingredients in ideal conditions, then harvest them in an eco-friendly way.
            </p>  
            <p>  
                Our activation process keeps the goodness of nature without excess heat or unnecessary chemical solvents. That means our natural ingredients are pure and potent.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Finally, we balance our formulas and put them to the test. Through extensive clinicals, we get proof that each one re-balances skin, so it looks visibly healthier and resilient over time.
