        <h2 class="header--large">Good Foods for Your Skin:</h2>

        <h3 class="header--medium">Citrus, Fruits, and Peppers</h3>
        <p>
            These foods are loaded with vitamin C, an antioxidant that helps protect skin against surface free radicals. Surface free radicals, generated from UV rays and environmental pollutants, eventually cause wrinkles and a loss of skin firmness.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header--medium">Salmon, Eggs, and Dairy</h3>
        <p>
            These foods are good sources of vitamin D, a nutrient that helps the body absorb calcium for strong bones. And bone loss can contribute to sagging skin. Salmon is also high in essential fatty acids, like omega 3s, that help reduce inflammation.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="header--medium">Orange Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
        <p>
        Carrots, squash, sweet potatoes and mangoes, with their characteristic orange color, contain high levels of carotenoids, a derivative of Vitamin A. They provide antioxidants and help protect skin against surface free radicals.
